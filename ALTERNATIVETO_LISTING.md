## Full Description

ThreadShifter is a free, web-based embroidery file converter that eliminates the need for expensive software just to change file formats. Convert between all major embroidery machine formats instantly - including DST (Tajima), PES (Brother), JEF (Janome), EXP (Melco), XXX (Singer), VP3 (Pfaff), U01 (Barudan), and PEC (Brother).

**Why ThreadShifter Exists:**
Professional embroidery software like Wilcom, PE-Design, and Hatch costs $169-$2,000+ annually, yet many users only need basic file conversion. ThreadShifter provides professional-quality conversion completely free, making embroidery accessible to hobbyists, small businesses, and professionals alike.

**Key Features:**

• **8 Format Support:** Convert between DST, PES, JEF, EXP, XXX, VP3, U01, and PEC formats
• **Smart Hoop Sizing:** Automatically scales designs to fit your hoop size (4x4", 5x7", 6x10") with safety checks
• **Color Intelligence:** Converts DST files (no color data) to PES with high-contrast color palettes
• **Universal Compatibility:** Forces PES v6 for compatibility with all Brother machines (old and new)
• **Instant Conversion:** Files process in under 2 milliseconds
• **No Installation Required:** Works entirely in your web browser
• **Privacy-Focused:** Files processed in-memory and never stored on servers
• **No Account Needed:** No registration, no login, no limitations
• **Unlimited Use:** Convert as many files as you need, completely free
• **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, tablets, and phones
• **Professional Quality:** Uses pyembroidery library (industry standard)

**Perfect For:**

• Home embroiderers who own Brother, Janome, or other machines
• Small embroidery businesses needing quick format conversions
• Professionals switching between machine brands
